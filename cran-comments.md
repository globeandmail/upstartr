## Change notes
As requested by reviewer, adds `@return` for `reorder_within`, `scale_x_reordered` and `scale_y_reordered` functions. In DESCRIPTION, added The Globe and Mail Inc. as a copyright holder, and Michael Pereira as a contributor given his work on the main [`startr`](https://github.com/globeandmail/startr) package, which this project was born out of.
